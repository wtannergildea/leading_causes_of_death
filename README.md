# Leading Causes of Death in the U.S.

I analyze the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's dataset on the leading causes of death in the United States. Their data collection begins in 1999 and covers up until 2016. 

The dataset is available [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/age-adjusted-death-rates-for-the-top-10-leading-causes-of-death-united-states-2013).
